# delta-tracker

delta-tracker allows you to view real-time statistics while onboard a Delta flight. I was bored on my flight today, wanted to see what font Delta was using on the wifi portal and then ended up finding the API endpoint for flight stats. 30 minutes later I ended up with the following.

TBH I wish the Delta API returned more data than it does. Next time I'm on a flight I might try to combine this with an API that can provide more data like [Flightaware](https://flightaware.com).
